# noisy-speech-recognition
ML engine to remove background noise from speech and print speech to text. 

2 main features:

- Remove background noise using spectral gating - a Digital Signal Processing technique

- Recognize speech using convolutional neural network.

Please see the iPython Notebooks in this repo for full code graphics, and results.
